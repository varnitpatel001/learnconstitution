      <h1>Fundamental Duties</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        Fundamental Duties are an essential part of the Constitution of India, introduced by the 42nd Amendment in 1976. These duties serve as a reminder to citizens that while they enjoy certain rights, they also have corresponding responsibilities towards the nation. Enshrined in Article 51A, these duties aim to promote a sense of discipline and commitment among citizens to uphold the dignity of the country and contribute to its well-being.
      </p></div>
<div className="article mb-5">
      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p className="lead">
        The concept of Fundamental Duties was inspired by the Constitution of the former Soviet Union, which emphasized the responsibilities of citizens. The inclusion of Fundamental Duties in the Indian Constitution was a response to the growing need for civic responsibility, particularly during the tumultuous period of the Emergency (1975-1977). The framers of the Constitution recognized that rights and duties are inherently linked, and for a democracy to thrive, citizens must be aware of and fulfill their obligations to the state and society.
