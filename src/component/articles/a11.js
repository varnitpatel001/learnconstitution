      <h1>Fundamental Rights</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        Fundamental Rights are a set of rights enshrined in the Constitution of India, designed to protect the liberties and freedoms of individuals against any arbitrary actions of the state. They are guaranteed to all citizens, ensuring that every individual has access to the same basic rights, irrespective of their caste, creed, religion, or gender.
      </p>

      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <p className="lead">
        The concept of Fundamental Rights has its roots in various historical documents and movements advocating for human rights and individual freedoms. Influences can be traced back to the Magna Carta (1215) and the Bill of Rights (1689) in England, as well as the American Bill of Rights (1791) and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789). These historical texts laid the groundwork for the formulation of Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution, which was adopted on 26th January 1950.
