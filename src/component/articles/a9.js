      <h1>The Judiciary of India</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        The judiciary is the guardian of the Constitution and the protector of the rule of law in India. It plays a vital role in interpreting laws, administering justice, and ensuring the protection of fundamental rights. The Indian judiciary is independent, impartial, and serves as a check on the powers of the executive and the legislature. It consists of a hierarchical structure with the Supreme Court at its apex, followed by High Courts and subordinate courts.
