      <h1>Elections in India</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        Elections are a fundamental aspect of democracy, providing citizens with the opportunity to choose their representatives and participate in the governance of the country. In India, elections are conducted at various levels, including the Lok Sabha (House of the People), Rajya Sabha (Council of States), State Legislative Assemblies, and local bodies. The electoral process is governed by the Constitution of India and is administered by the Election Commission of India (ECI), an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for overseeing free and fair elections in the country.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Elections</h2>
      <p className="lead">
        Elections in India can be categorized into several types based on the level of governance and the nature of the electoral body:
      </p>
      <ul className="lead">
        <li>
          <strong>General Elections:</strong> These are held every five years to elect Members of Parliament (MPs) to the Lok Sabha. General elections are conducted simultaneously in all states and Union territories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>State Assembly Elections:</strong> Elections to the Legislative Assemblies of states and Union territories are held every five years. Each state has its own electoral process, governed by the same principles as the Lok Sabha elections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>By-elections:</strong> By-elections are conducted to fill vacancies that occur in the Lok Sabha or State Assemblies between general elections due to resignation, death, or disqualification of elected members.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Body Elections:</strong> Elections are held for urban and rural local bodies, such as municipal corporations, panchayati raj institutions, and other local governance bodies.
