      <h1>The State Government in India</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        The state government is an essential component of the Indian federal system, responsible for governing the states and implementing policies and laws at the state level. Each state in India has its own government, which operates independently within the framework of the Constitution. The state government is tasked with ensuring the welfare of its citizens and managing state resources efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure of the State Government</h2>
      <p className="lead">
        The structure of the state government is modeled after the parliamentary system of governance, similar to the central government. It comprises three main branches:
      </p>
      <ul className="lead">
        <li>
          <strong>Executive:</strong> The executive branch is headed by the Governor, who is appointed by the President of India. The Governor acts as the ceremonial head of the state, while the Chief Minister, elected by the majority party or coalition in the Legislative Assembly, is the real executive authority. The Chief Minister is supported by a council of ministers responsible for various departments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legislature:</strong> The legislature in a state consists of two houses in some states (bicameral) and one house in others (unicameral). The Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) is the lower house, and the Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad) is the upper house (in bicameral states). The legislature is responsible for making laws, controlling finances, and representing the interests of the people.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Judiciary:</strong> The state judiciary operates independently and includes the High Court and subordinate courts. The judiciary interprets state laws, resolves disputes, and protects the fundamental rights of citizens at the state level.
        </li>
      </ul>
