      <h1>The Union Government of India</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        The Union Government of India is the central governing authority of the country, responsible for administering and governing the nation as a whole. It operates under the framework established by the Constitution of India, which outlines its structure, functions, and powers. The Union Government plays a crucial role in maintaining the unity and integrity of the country while ensuring that the rights and responsibilities of citizens are upheld.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure of the Union Government</h2>
      <p className="lead">
        The Union Government comprises three primary branches: the Executive, the Legislature, and the Judiciary. Each branch operates independently while maintaining a system of checks and balances to ensure accountability and efficiency.
      </p>

      <h3>1. The Executive</h3>
      <p className="lead">
        The Executive is headed by the President of India, who is the ceremonial head of state. The real executive power lies with the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, and the Council of Ministers. The President appoints the Prime Minister and, on their advice, appoints other ministers. The Executive is responsible for implementing laws, formulating policies, and overseeing the functioning of the various departments of the government.
      </p>

      <h3>2. The Legislature</h3>
      <p className="lead">
        The Legislature, also known as the Parliament of India, is a bicameral body consisting of two houses: the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). The Lok Sabha members are directly elected by the people, while the Rajya Sabha members are elected by the State Legislative Assemblies. The primary functions of the Legislature include making laws, discussing national issues, and scrutinizing the Executive's actions.
      </p>

      <h3>3. The Judiciary</h3>
      <p className="lead">
        The Judiciary is an independent body that interprets laws and ensures justice. It is headed by the Supreme Court of India, which is the highest court of appeal. The Judiciary has the authority to review laws enacted by the Legislature and actions taken by the Executive, ensuring they comply with the Constitution. This branch plays a crucial role in safeguarding fundamental rights and maintaining the rule of law.
